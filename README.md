# Python Web Scraping
 Web scraping on a mountain bike e-commerce website with the objective to see the prices variation on the same products.
 
 The application has two scripts, one for the first time the user is running this project and a second one for everytime after that.
 
 The first one fetches the information on the selected sites and create an excel to save the information.
 After the first use of the first script, the second script will be the only one used if the user wants to keep the results on the same excel file.
 
 This second script will access the pre-selected web pages, fetch the pre-determined information, print it on the screen and save it to the existing excel file (created before with the first use of the first script) on a different tab with the date as the name of that tab.
